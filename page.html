<li>Keep it simple – From product design to customer contracts and how we operate as a company, eliminate complexity to focus on what is important.</li>
<li>Value our customers – Our customers are our employers and investors.  We need to provide great value to them so that they are happy to pay for our products (though it is ok to fire bad customers).</li>
<li>Employee growth and satisfaction – We want employees who believe in our principles, are a great match for their role, love what they do, and have an impact on the success of the company.</li>
<li>Profit-led growth – Consistency is more important than speed.  Doing the right thing is superior to doing a lot of things.  Stay aligned with our customers.</li>
<li>Product-led growth – Be so good they can’t ignore us.  Our customers are our best sales people.</li>
<li>Be different – Be deliberate and don’t do things just because other people do them.  Be authentic.</li>
<li>Don’t be boring – We need to stand out among all the noise.  Everything we do in public should provide value to the audience.</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Hiring Process</strong></div><ul>
<li>Our first step is to ask applicants to fill out a Google form with some relatively easy questions.  Our goal here is to be able to easily weed out applicants who apply without reading the job post or who are not qualified.</li>
<li>A short screening interview for qualified candidates.</li>
<li>An interview with the founder who is also the primary developer.</li>
<li>A take-home programming challenge that should take about an hour.</li>
<li>A joint-coding session with the founder.</li>
<li>Short interviews with our other two employees for a culture fit.</li>
<li>Reference checks.</li>

<li>Stability<ul><li>Everything we build is intentional and thought out. We build knowing that we’ll be working on this code for years. We index on quality over speed. Our tech reflects our love for stability in that we use typescript heavily and write tests thoroughly. </li></ul>
</li>
<li> Iteration<ul><li>Much like a good essay each PR requires at least 2 reviewers and involves rounds of revision and improvement. We embrace this and the challenges that come with it.</li></ul>

<li>Learning<ul><li>None of us have arrived. We want to keep learning, experimenting and developing our own skills and our technology over time. Anyone willing to make a case for a new upgrade is heard.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Async work and communication<ul><li>We have very few meetings. We embrace JOMO (The joy of missing out). This allows for deep focus and we want as much flow in our work as possible.

<li>You see your code as your own property and are therefore defensive of your work and ideas <ul><li>Pride gets in the way of progress and we are all learning. </li></ul>

<li>You need someone to tell you how to spend your time at work<ul><li>We are all adults and are not here to babysit.</li></ul>

<li>Are easily offended <ul><li>We value direct clear communication without sugar coating.   </li></ul>

<br>Our tech: NextJS focused, with some event driven flair thrown in. Really focus is on strongly typed TypeScript—you need to bleed types. TypeScript, NextJS, and database skills are all wins. <br><br>
</div><div><strong>Senior Full-Stack Engineer:</strong></div><div>This role requires being a member of a team that is highly collaborative.

<br><strong>Our flagship product</strong> is a <strong>vast platform</strong> with over 30 sub-domains for online courses, masterclasses, online forums, and community meet-ups in 508 cities in 107 countries. We understand what PHP developers need to thrive, and we've created an environment that delivers.  </div><ul>
<li>
<strong>Close to Legacy-Free Codebase.</strong> We know how technical debt and legacy code can turn into quicksand, so we continually eradicate it. Some examples include <strong>the complete rewrite of our notification and payment system </strong>and numerous enhancements made to our course platform<strong>.</strong> </li>
<li>
<strong>Consistent Coding Standards.</strong> We are proud of our strict coding standards, which is the cornerstone of our clean and maintainable codebase. You can find numerous examples in the <a href="https://handbook.interaction-design.org/">IxDF Handbook</a>, which includes our conventions for <a href="https://handbook.interaction-design.org/library/backend/conventions--php.html">PHP</a>, <a href="https://handbook.interaction-design.org/library/backend/conventions--laravel.html">Laravel</a>, <a href="https://handbook.interaction-design.org/library/backend/conventions--sql.html">SQL</a>, <a href="https://handbook.interaction-design.org/library/frontend/conventions--js.html">JavaScript</a>, and <a href="https://handbook.interaction-design.org/library/frontend/conventions--css.html">CSS</a>, along with other <a href="https://handbook.interaction-design.org/library/backend/literature.html">useful resources</a>. You can also find other examples in the <a href="https://ui-kit.interaction-design.org/">IxDF UI Kit,</a> which we’re currently rebuilding into an industry-leading  Design System and our <a href="https://ui-kit.interaction-design.org/components">handy IxDF component library</a>. </li>
<li>
<strong>Crystal-Clear Documentation.</strong> Clarity is key. Any line of code should be a succinct, well-crafted, and self-explanatory piece of communication to your future self or your colleague. To string things together, we mix in just the right amount of documentation, with best practices such as focusing on the “why?” and keeping it simple.  </li>
<li>
<strong>Focus on what matters</strong>: Our CI/CD pipeline uses quality tools such as Psalm, PHPStan, Rector, PHPCS, PHP-CS-Fixer, Deptrac, phpcpd, and ESLint to ensure consistency and code quality. This means we’re almost bug-free despite having numerous, zero-downtime, fully automated deployments to production every day. We don’t like bugs and would rather focus on what matters most. </li>
<li>
<strong>Test Coverage</strong>: “The only way to go fast is to go well - Robert C. Martin”. We love automated testing, especially Unit Tests, and use TDD as much as we can. We've been increasing our test coverage over the years, reaching an overall 38% test coverage throughout the system, with critical systems having over 80% test coverage. <br><br>
</li>
</ul><div><strong>The Stack You Will Work On </strong></div><div>
<br>#UseThePlatform. We focus on enduring technologies over the latest fleeting frameworks so that <strong>our developers' knowledge continually grows</strong> instead of becoming outdated after each trend has passed. This philosophy allows us to build robust, maintainable and <strong>beautiful code that stands the test of time</strong> rather than chasing the latest hype. Some of our key technologies include: </div><ul>

<li>Modular monolith comprising 30+ bounded contexts </li>

<li>
<strong>Fixed Time, Variable Scope</strong> – We work in <strong>monthly cycles</strong> with clear priorities. We decide how much time we want to spend on a problem and shape solutions to fit within that timeframe.</li>
<li>
<strong>Shaping Before Betting</strong> – Work isn’t thrown into a backlog. Before a project gets scheduled, we <strong>shape it</strong>—defining the problem, solution, risks, and constraints upfront. Only well-formed ideas make it to development.</li>
<li>
<strong>Small Teams, Full Ownership</strong> – Developers and designers work in <strong>small, autonomous teams</strong>. No micromanaging. No back-and-forth over tiny details. The team decides how to execute within the defined problem space.</li>
<li>
<strong>Integrated Workflows</strong> – Instead of breaking work into rigid "frontend" and "backend" tasks, we focus on delivering <strong>end-to-end solutions</strong>.</li>
<li>
<strong>No Endless Meetings</strong> – We believe in <strong>asynchronous work</strong>. Updates are written, decisions are documented, and meetings are rare but meaningful.</li>

<div>
<br>Right now, we’re looking for an Internet of Things Technical Lead with experience leading projects and collaborating closely with product owners.<br><br>
</div><div>
<br>In this role, you’ll be joining our team as a senior developer eager to find cost-effective, high-quality, pragmatic solutions to our clients' complex problems. You might identify as a Technical Lead, a Technical Architect, or a Technical Program Manager, and — as you might expect with “technical” in the title — you would be the person on the project team most responsible for delivering the most appropriate and cost-effective technical solution for the client’s needs.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong><br>Responsibilities will include:<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Crafting technical architecture plans through interfacing with clients to understand product requirements</li>
<li>Planning development work with your team through scoping and estimation</li>
<li>Developing and optimizing technical solutions while keeping in mind performance, scalability, maintainability, and cost-effectiveness</li>
<li>Participating in code reviews, providing constructive feedback to teammates and ensuring adherence to best practices</li>
<li>Contributing to project success by keeping a close eye on team velocity, project scope, budget, and timeline</li>
<li>Negotiating with clients to align project scope with budget and timeline, if needed</li>
</ul><div>
<br>The person we’re looking for is happy, relaxed and easy to get along with. They’re flexible on anything except conceits that will lower their usually outstanding work quality. They work “smart”, by carefully managing their workflow and staggering features that have dependencies intelligently — they prefer deep work but are OK coming up to the surface now and then for top level / strategic conversations.<br><br>
</div><div>
<br>We believe people with backgrounds or interests in design, art, music, food or fashion tend to have a well rounded sense of design &amp; quality — so a variety of hobbies or side projects is a big nice to have!<br><br>Read more here: https://garden3d.notion.site/Internet-of-Things-Technical-Lead-192131fea2c7802f94a3e9f6b8101113<br><br>

The purpose of these solutions is to run intricate and highly detailed processes of our clients, and boost their business process efficiency with error minimization, process automation, and other business process enhancements.<br><br>These solutions are composed of internal systems (such as CRM, ERP or other systems heavily customized and extended by us), integrated with the external systems (such as client portals) and various custom backend connections that allow interaction with external parties as needed. Our tech stack is largely based on React and Typescript (the knowledge of which is required for this role as well).<br><br>Our solutions are completely custom to each client and have a lot of custom functionality in them. To deliver such solutions with high quality and high efficiency, our organization has developed very specific processes for how we run our development operation and very specific back-end and front-end toolkits to reuse functionalities and utilities and to minimize unnecessary development work for each client.<br><br>The Role of Software Design Engineer is a technical solution design role within ESA. This role is reserved only for very technically skilled individuals with software development background and the actual ability to build quality working software, and an established familiarity in ESA's core tech stack based around React and Typescript. Having developed software design skills and experience will be a major plus for any candidate coming in for this role, but is secondary to technical software development abilities. Our methodology relies on skilled developers with real software building experience to design our complex and functional software solutions.<br><br>Software Design Engineers on ESA team work together with the business process experts who make decisions on how the business processes of our clients need to be re-organized, re-engineered, digitized, and automated. The business process experts are responsible for the business operations and business decisions side of the matter, while the Software Design Engineers are responsible for the software functionality, design, and assuring technical implementation of a software solution that will effectively address business process requirements of the business process experts. The Software Design Engineers concept, architect, detail out, wireframe, and oversee the full functional and technical design of the software solutions. Much of the technical implementation is handled by our software development team composed of front-end and back-end software engineers, as well as QA engineers, but Software Design Engineers assure successful implementations and iterate them as needed to serve the needs of successful operation of these software solutions in our clients' businesses.<br><br><strong>Click "Apply" To Go To Our Site</strong><br>This job board has a char limit, and this job description is abridged on this site.

<strong>Who is suitable for this Software Design Engineer role?</strong> <br>The main trait required for this job is the <strong>ability to build something that works and successfully meets the specific business requirements</strong>. Our typical <strong>Software Design Engineer</strong> is either someone who is already doing a similar job right now (and maybe not being credited for it) or someone who has been working as a software developer but who wants to go beyond that and really make a difference in <em>how software is designed</em>, instead of just implementing what was designed by someone else. If you are a developer with the ability to grasp the bigger picture, but in your current job you frequently feel frustrated by bad or missing requirements, by designs with low quality standards, or that fail to consider all usage scenarios, and otherwise not being optimal, then you might be the right person for <em>this</em> job.<br> <br>The Software Design Engineer is:<br><br>
</div><ul>
<li>
<strong>A builder</strong>, with intricate commercial experience of software development, understanding how it works, common software development concepts such as REST APIs, typecasting, synchronous and asynchronous execution, cache invalidation, etc., and can actually build a working software solution from the ground up.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>A critical thinker</strong>, who uses logic and rational thought in the analysis of business requirements, understanding the big picture as well as the finer details, and who relies on data to make decisions, asking questions when needed, instead of resorting to guesswork.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>A problem solver</strong>, who can split big problems into smaller, manageable chunks, and who doesn't get stuck on seemingly unsolvable problems, always finding practical, simple, feasible, effective and efficient solutions.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Someone with a knack for software design</strong>, who can conceptualize functionality to meet business goals and communicate how this can be accomplished by designing user flows, low-fidelity wireframes, flow charts, etc., as well as specifying all the technical requirements for the implementation of the solution.<br><br>
</li>
</ul><div>The Software Design Engineer is:<br><br>
</div><ul>
<li>
<strong>NOT a business analyst:</strong> won’t write business requirements.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>NOT a "solutions architect":</strong> won’t design vague “solution architectures”, instead will design highly detailed and intricate solutions, detailing all intricate front-end and back-end functionality.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>NOT a salesman:</strong> won't sell software nor have direct contact with customers.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>NOT a UX Researcher: </strong>won’t interview stakeholders nor run user research.<br><br>
</li>
<li>
<strong>NOT a UX/UI designer: </strong>knowledge of basic UX and UI principles is required, but the job is much more than just making wireframes or prototypes.<br><br>
</li>
</ul><div>
<br><strong>As a Software Design Engineer, what will you be doing exactly?</strong>  <br><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Perform critical analysis of business requirements and business processes provided by our team of business process experts.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Develop a thorough understanding of the problem and scope of the solution.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Strategize the time and effort required for the implementation of the software solution and use that to construct designs that optimize for faster build-out while also meeting its requirements most effectively.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Conceptualize a feasible, effective and efficient solution, balancing business goals, user goals, cost, time, and any other constraints.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Perform a rigorous technical analysis of how a technically efficient and feasible solution should be built, which includes things like Database analysis, APIs analysis, external systems testing, proof of concepts construction and testing, validation of feasibility, and other intricately technical<br><br>
</li>
<li>Design and document all aspects of the solution:<br><br>
</li>
<li>Design and document the general architecture of the solution as a whole, conceptualizing its technical components and various integrations.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Design and document User Flows for all user-facing functionality.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Design all back-end flows and document them in flowcharts and other representations.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Define all the technical specifications required to implement all functionalities and automations.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Design low-fi wireframes for all user interfaces (your low-fi wireframes should be good enough to be used by developers in implementing the solution, in very rare cases high fidelity wireframes may need to be made but we almost always rely on low-fi wireframes in all of our operations).<br><br>
</li>
<li>Create state diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams, flow charts, and any other technical specifications that might be required to communicate the technical requirements of your solution properly.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Collate all the designs, specifications, requirements, and other documentation and hand them over to the Development Team for implementation.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Assist the Development Team and the QA Team in developing, testing, and deployment.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Actively participate in the implementation and assure the end goal of deploying a production-grade, fully functional, and efficient solution that meets all of the specified business requirements.<br><br>

</li>
<li>Professional knowledge and successful experience with front-end development, back-end and full-stack development, databases, APIs, and all other key software development concepts;<br><br>
</li>
<li>Specific and strong experience with and knowledge of React and Typescript - this is required due to Elite Software Automation's tech stack, in this job you will sometimes find yourself working as a developer in our development team, and you must be fully capable of what our developers are capable of with our stack;<br><br>
</li>
<li>Understanding of what this job is and having genuine desire and interest in utilizing your skills and experience in a Software Design Engineer capacity is required;<br><br>
</li>
<li>Experience with either designing software from the ground up or with developing complex software effectively while not being given a detailed design that somebody else made (in effect coming up with design of your software while building it and working from only vague business-side-only requirements) in your past career is also required.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Ability and willingness to work extremely hard. <strong>This is a very difficult job</strong>. It is also likely that it will require a lot of fast on-the-job learning for you to become good at it.

  <strong>Headquarters:</strong> USA

</p>

<div>The basics<br><br>
</div><ul>
<li>The <strong>stack</strong>: Postgres, Node.js/Express.js, React. Currently running on Heroku, eventually AWS</li>
<li>The <strong>product</strong>: We're building the ultimate suite for Finance teams to manage everything from billing to revenue recognition to subscription metrics, and much more</li>
<li>The <strong>way we work</strong>:<ul>
<li>This is a <strong>remote job</strong> - work anywhere you want, and in any timezone on earth (or outside earth, whatever).</li>
<li>We are an <strong>asynchronous</strong> team - we don't do scheduled meetings, and rely on each team member to pick their own schedule and to communicate clearly in writing and with recorded videos. <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/1b92593aaf5f41abb2450869085dc3a5"><strong>Hear from our co-founder Michelle Lee on what it's like to work asynchronously (click here)</strong>.</a>
</li>
<li>We operate completely <strong>autonomously</strong> - no one will tell you what to do, we'll just tell you the goals and you will figure out how to work towards them with the rest of the team.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>role you'll play</strong> on our team:<ul>
<li>You'd be one of the <strong>first ten</strong> engineers on the team.</li>
<li>You'll <strong>work on</strong><ul>
<li>Backend: database design and implementation, complex data management problems, API design and implementation, writing tests</li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Like all start-ups we're scrappy, but not scrappy on compensation: Subscript is committed to paying our awesome team members at <strong>market-rate, including benefits.</strong>
</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div>
<strong>Our interview process<br></strong><br>
</div><div>Our interview process is designed to focus on <strong>your skills</strong> as a software engineer, and your ability to <strong>communicate clearly</strong>. We're a fully asynchronous company, so that's how we will communicate in this interview process too 🙂.<br><br>
</div><ol>
<li>We'll ask you to work on a small code challenge</li>
<li>After reviewing the short code challenge, we'll ask you to work on a <strong>~90 minute exercise </strong>while recording a loom (or other screen recording) video.</li>
<li>If the video interview above goes well, we'll want to learn a bit more about <strong>how you communicate in writing</strong> - we will ask you to put together a <strong>technical design document</strong>. This is one of the biggest ways we communicate at Subscript, so we want to see that you can work well with that!</li>
</ol><div>And finally, hopefully we'll send you an offer. And hopefully you'll accept!<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Requirements<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>You're an excellent engineer (you write high quality code, you write great tests, you ship quickly)</li>
<li>You're a great communicator via writing, and via recorded videos.</li>
<li>You're excited about working on a globally-distributed and diverse team, in an incredibly unique culture where autonomy, accountability, and ownership are equally as valued as your skillset.</li>
<li>That's it!</li>
</ul><div>
<strong>Benefits<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Unlimited vacation</li>
<li>Completely flexible work schedule - work literally anytime (and anywhere) you want!</li>
<li>Benefits appropriate to your location (health/dental/vision in the USA)</li>
<li>Company wide retreats multiple times per year</li>
<li>Like all start-ups we're scrappy, but not scrappy on compensation: Subscript is committed to paying our awesome team members at market-rate, including benefits.</li>

</div><div>You're a tech adventurer with at least 5 years of experience who can write killer code, crack a joke, and doesn't break into a cold sweat when someone says "git rebase."

<li>
<strong>ORM Savvy:</strong> You can use one, but you're happier slinging SQL yourself.</li>
<li>
<strong>UI/UX Sense:</strong> You appreciate good design, even if your idea of a palette is "light mode or dark mode?"</li>
<li>
<strong>Git Ninja:</strong> You know your way around git rebase and git merge without needing a counselor.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fast Learner:</strong> You're excited to play with shiny new tech and can get shit done without needing a babysitter.</li>

</ul><div>
<strong>Bonus Points if You<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Have dabbled with LLMs, training models, or Agentic workflows</li>
<li>Understand that "scrappy" isn't just a dog—it's a way of life</li>
<li>Think contributing to open source isn't just cool; it's the right thing to do</li>
</ul><div>
<strong>What You'll Be Doing<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Collaborating with the CTO to build, optimize, and scale core products</li>
<li>Writing robust, maintainable code across our stack</li>
<li>Engaging in building and fine-tuning workflows that may involve generative AI pipelines</li>
<li>Innovating within our open-source-first ecosystem and making meaningful contributions back</li>
<li>Balancing the act of moving fast vs. being careful (sometimes on the same day)</li>
</ul><div>
<strong>Why You'll Love Working With Us<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>
<strong>Ground Floor Vibes:</strong> Early-stage startup with room to grow and learn</li>
<li>
<strong>Flexibility:</strong> Work where you're most productive</li>
<li>
<strong>A Fun Bunch:</strong> We mean business but aren't afraid to crack a joke</li>
<li>
<strong>Tech Playground:</strong> We don't just use the latest tech; we experiment and build it</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div>
<strong>Ready to Join?<br></strong><br>
</div><div>Shoot us your resume, GitHub link, or whatever you think shows off your skills. If you've got a portfolio of side projects or an open-source contribution you're proud of, show it off!</div><div><br></div><div>We're excited to build with you. No egos, no nonsense—just great code, hard work, and some fun along the way.</div><div>
