<li>Keep it simple – From product design to customer contracts and how we operate as a company, eliminate complexity to focus on what is important.</li>
<li>Value our customers – Our customers are our employers and investors.  We need to provide great value to them so that they are happy to pay for our products (though it is ok to fire bad customers).</li>
<li>Employee growth and satisfaction – We want employees who believe in our principles, are a great match for their role, love what they do, and have an impact on the success of the company.</li>
<li>Profit-led growth – Consistency is more important than speed.  Doing the right thing is superior to doing a lot of things.  Stay aligned with our customers.</li>
<li>Product-led growth – Be so good they can’t ignore us.  Our customers are our best sales people.</li>
<li>Be different – Be deliberate and don’t do things just because other people do them.  Be authentic.</li>
<li>Don’t be boring – We need to stand out among all the noise.  Everything we do in public should provide value to the audience.</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>Hiring Process</strong></div><ul>
<li>Our first step is to ask applicants to fill out a Google form with some relatively easy questions.  Our goal here is to be able to easily weed out applicants who apply without reading the job post or who are not qualified.</li>
<li>A short screening interview for qualified candidates.</li>
<li>An interview with the founder who is also the primary developer.</li>
<li>A take-home programming challenge that should take about an hour.</li>
<li>A joint-coding session with the founder.</li>
<li>Short interviews with our other two employees for a culture fit.</li>
<li>Reference checks.</li>

</p>

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>Are you looking for that rare opportunity that deeply impacts the clients you serve? We have been market leaders in the beauty industry since 2016 serving salon owners with transformational education. Over the last 4 years we've built our reputation on one single offer and we're at a point where our lead volume is so high that it's time to hire the perfect sales advisor. </p>
<h3></h3>
<p><strong>Why PIP University exists</strong></p>
<p>We're on a mission to change the landscape of our industry. It's changed drastically over the last 5-10 years, so much so it's almost unrecognizable. Our curriculum took 4 full years to build out. It is the most forward thinking, implement-able education that's available. Profitable businesses, career hairstylists and thriving families is a byproduct of our program and the more we can get it into the hands of salon owners across the country, the more lives we can Positively Impact. (PIP = Positively Impacting People)</p>
<p>This is impossible without you. Right now, the interest for our program is so strong, we can't enroll salons fast enough. This role is our #1 priority for our company.<br></p>
<p><strong>What does PIP University do?</strong></p>
<p>We help salon owners increase their profit margin to 20% after working with us for 12 months in our robust, digital course. They have a timeline and tasks they complete across 8 chapters and 70 lessons within our program. This helps them to work less behind the chair themselves, greatly increase revenue, profit, and grow their team. </p>
<p></p>
<p>One of our students Ashley Thomas, a salon owner in Pennsylvania, started working with us at the end of her first year in business. She had a smaller team and told us that she had no systems or structure. By the end of her 2nd year in business, they hit a million (2021). By 2023 she had purchased and renovated a 5k sq ft historic building, grew her team significantly and hit over 1.6M in sales.</p>
<p>These are the people you'll be bringing to us. <em>Do you want to be a part of leaving this kind of mark on people and their families?</em><br></p>
<p><strong>Who will you work with?</strong></p>
<p>You will work closely with Samantha, our Director of Sales, and Jacob our Media Ad buyer. </p>
<p>You will also be working alongside the rest of our team. We have a healthy, fast paced environment where we're all self driven and still collaborative!</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Where will you work?</strong></p>
<p>We work remotely and have since the beginning. We're scattered all over, from Omaha to Vegas and Houston to Chicago. </p>
<p>That means you have the flexibility to work from home, or a co-working location, or to take the family to Bali for the summer and never skip a beat. <br></p>
<p><strong>You will own 2 primary metrics as a Sales Representative:</strong></p>
<p>1. Book to Close rate</p>
<p>2. The # of closed clients / $ revenue generated</p>
<p>3. # of calls booked off our paid funnel</p>
<p>Those 3 primary metrics will be supported by a number of strategic activities:</p>
<ol> <li>Effective outbound communication to increase the number of leads we talk to</li> <li>Making offers to qualified leads</li> <li>Managing the sales process to close leads quickly and efficiently</li> </ol>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Are you a fit for this role?</strong></p>
<p>If you come from corporate America and crave autonomy, leadership that encourages your ideas, and being a part of a forward-thinking, healthy team, you're in for a treat. </p>
<p>If you've been doing this solo but need more collaboration, support, and resources to make the impact you know you can, you'll thrive at PIP University. </p>
<p>If you come from an agency, our strategic risk taking, innovation and quick shifting might be uncomfortable for you at first. But your past experience will serve you well here. You'll get to really dive in and do your thing. </p>
<p><em>However, if you operate best with clearly defined day to day duties and leadership coaching you on every step...... this is not the job for you. </em></p>
<p></p>
<p>One of our Core Values states: We are in the pursuit of mastery. We are here to develop unshakeable skill sets. It's not enough to make an incremental difference. We want to do in a day what others do in weeks. To accomplish in a month, what takes others years.</p>
<p>Do you want to be on the front lines and directly involved in growing some of THE coolest and most innovative companies in the world?<br><br>I can't wait to connect with you!</p>
<p></p>

And building the technology for the platform is where you come in.<br><br>
</div><div><br></div><div>
<br>We're looking for an experienced back-end engineer to join our (fully distributed) Platform &amp; Product team to help take the platform on to the next level, supporting the growing needs of the Codeable business and the client, expert and partner communities who we work with.

</div><h1>Role summary</h1><div>
<br>We are looking for a performance-minded back-end engineer with an eye towards writing well-designed, maintainable code who will be responsible for managing and maintaining our back-end system(s) and operating related services connected to it and make sure they (become and) stay performant. <br><br>

<br>Your primary focus will be the development of server-side logic, ensuring high performance and responsiveness of our back-end system and related services, like our databases (PostgreSQL, Redis), background jobs system (Sidekiq), and other services (internal and external).<br><br>
</div><div><br></div><div>
<br>Since our backend system is not very new, there are a lot of opportunities to make it better and scalable so we can speed up the growth of our business worry-free. If you are someone who is not afraid to grab a system by its cables and get your hands dirty then you’re at the right place.<br><br>
</div><h1>Key responsibilities</h1><ul>
<li>Collaborating within our product team to develop new features, fix bugs, and reduce technical debt (you will be involved in the whole application lifecycle)</li>
<li>Defining and communicating technical requirements</li>
<li>Building high-quality systems that can be (re)used and extended in the future</li>
<li>Helping set the design/architectural guidelines to make sure our codebase is improving</li>
<li>Making sure our back-end is scalable (fast response times, optimized DB queries, …)</li>
<li>Troubleshooting, debugging, and fixing production issues</li>
</ul><h1>Required qualifications</h1><ul>
<li>5+ years of experience with Ruby and Rails in production on a decently sized project</li>
<li>Experience building &amp; growing web applications, APIs, services</li>
<li>In-depth experience of back-end APIs (RESTful web services)</li>
<li>In-depth experience of writing tests: unit, integration, …</li>
<li>Very good understanding of databases: query performance, indexes, migrations (PostgreSQL)</li>
<li>Experience working with background processing (Sidekiq) and how to optimize it for good performance</li>
<li>Ability and desire to produce modular, maintainable code</li>
<li>Solid understanding and experience of Git (branching workflows, managing conflicts, …)</li>
<li>Solid understanding and experience with web (API) security</li>
<li>Experience implementing caching on Rails APIs</li>
<li>Experience working with WebSockets (we use Pusher, but that’s not a requirement)</li>
<li>Strong interest in continued (personal and professional) development (learning new technologies and programming languages)</li>
<li>Good communication skills (English) and willingness to improve. We value quality over quantity</li>
<li>Comfortable working in a remote distributed environment with a high degree of personal autonomy and responsibility</li>
</ul><h1>Bonus points</h1><ul>
<li>Front-end development knowledge and experience (JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Angular)</li>
<li>Familiarity with Google Cloud services</li>
<li>Experience with using Docker</li>
<li>Experience with using and deploying to Kubernetes</li>
<li>Experience with data analysis (SQL, BigQuery, Looker)</li>
<li>WordPress experience is a plus (since that's the ecosystem we operate within as a business)</li>
</ul><h1>Location</h1><div>
<br>Remote, in Europe, with at least a 6-hour overlap with GMT+1 to get a good overlap with the rest of the team. Codeable is fully distributed with ~15 full-time employees.<br><br>
</div><h1>The Process</h1><div>
<br>Please include your resume and salary expectations, and let us know why you’re the one for us and why we’re the one for you in the cover letter/message you send. <br><br>
</div><div><br></div><div>
<br>The application period ends at the end of March 2025. We’ll then review the applications received and contact you the following week if we want to move forward with you. The process will include regular interviews with various team members and practical tests. <br><br>
</div><div><br></div><div>
<br>We’re looking for someone who can start soon after the interviews are done. Around April or May 2025.<br><br>

<div>As a Breezy HR Customer Success Agent, you'll use your enthusiasm and empathy to help us troubleshoot, understand, and delight our incredible customer base. With over 60,000 active users, we need your help to maintain and communicate in line with our sky-high standards and ambitious product plans.<br><br>
</div><div>We have a unique approach to customer service; giving you a script to follow and expecting robotic output just isn't our style. You can feel free to use your own easygoing voice, and we'll support you with all the resources you need to make sure our customers are well-informed, well-oiled recruiting and hiring machines.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong><br>What Am I Going to Do All Day?<br></strong><br>
</div><div>
<br>This is a full time remote position and we're looking for someone who can work 10am to 7pm EST.<br><br>
</div><ul>
<li>You know that the best way to answer customer questions is to start from a solid knowledge base, so you’ll get to know and navigate Breezy inside-out and top-to-bottom.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Since you know it all (and you will!), you'll be helping our customers achieve their goals inside Breezy the majority of the day. You'll be walking them through processes and minor hiccups with patience and a sense of humor, but …<br><br>
</li>
<li>You know enough to know when you just <em>don’t </em>know. Then it'll be your job to escalate issues further up our little chain of command, or reach out to other teammates for help. You'll recognize when a customer might be a good fit for a demo, or might need some extra tech attention to get their problems solved.<br><br>
</li>
<li>You'll be tracking your support metrics and hitting (um, blowing past?) goals we set for our customer success team – these are numbers like response time and customer satisfaction (but you can handle that, right?).<br><br>
</li>
<li>You'll be on the front line, so we expect you to keep eyes out for trends in common issues, and help us develop training programs for future customers.<br><br>
</li>
</ul><div>
<strong><br>About You<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>This isn't your first rodeo – you should have some experience making customers happy as a primary job function.<br><br>
</li>
<li>You're enthusiastic and comfy around technology, the SaaS space, and/or recruiting and human resources (if you've got a soft spot for Trello and Intercom, that wouldn't hurt!)<br><br>
</li>
<li>You're even-tempered (dare we say … breezy?), but not passive. We want you to see problems or projects and tackle them head on, but we need you to be kind and professional about it.<br><br>
</li>
</ul><div>
<strong><br>About Breezy HR<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Breezy is a web-based, end-to-end recruiting platform and applicant tracking system to help teams attract &amp; hire great employees with less effort.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Grrrrreat benefits.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Inside, we're a small, agile team chock-full of awesomeness and we're growing fast.<br><br>
</li>
<li>Working here is completely unlike anything you'll find in Jacksonville or anywhere in the country... in a very <strong>good</strong> way. You'll love it.<br><br>
</li>

<h1>About Us and Why We’re Hiring</h1><div>We’re <a href="https://www.ynab.com/">YNAB</a> (“why-nab”), a financial education company with a spendfulness app that helps people all over the world spend their money (guilt-free!) on what matters most to them. For over 20 years, YNAB’s proven method has been changing lives—and people can’t stop telling their friends about the difference it’s made for them. Think: debt paid off, marriages strengthened, goals achieved, stress erased, and sleep finally restored. But don’t just take our word for it—dive into our vibrant communities on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ynabofficial/">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@ynabofficial">TikTok</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab/">Reddit</a> (really!) or skim through our glowing <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ynab-budgeting-finance/id1010865877">app</a> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.youneedabudget.evergreen.app&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1">reviews</a>. You’ll quickly see why people rave about YNAB and why we’re so passionate about creating something that truly changes lives for the better.</div><div><br></div><div>That’s no small task for our product teams, who navigate incredibly complex problems ranging from the psychology of spending money to the intricacies of Open Banking legislation. We have an entire product group dedicated solely to elevating “spendful” experiences in our app, and we’re excited to hire another Product Manager to join that effort. You’re the person we’re looking for if you’re passionate about helping more YNABers eliminate second-guessing about their spending, in less time and with less friction than ever before.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>What we’re looking for:</strong></div><div>We have <strong>five hard requirements</strong> for this role—you must:</div><ul>
<li>Have<em> at least</em> five years of experience as a Product Manager.</li>
<li>Be well versed in user-facing product work, particularly with cross-platform B2C SaaS applications.</li>
<li>Have a deep love for cross-functional product development (we really mean that cross-functional part!).</li>
<li>Have an interest in and facility with AI tools—prompt wizardry, custom GPTs, and fast prototyping are all tools in your tool box. You don’t just use AI to help you do your job, you harness it to 10x your skills and impact.</li>
<li>Live somewhere between the Pacific Time Zone (UTC-8) and the Central European Time Zone (UTC+1). (Think of a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Winkel_triple_projection_SW.jpg">world map</a> moving left to right from PT to CET—those time zones are all OK.)</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div>Beyond that, we’re open-minded. We value a diversity of experience and skills at YNAB, and every career path is different. That said, it may help you be successful in this role if you also have experience with things like:</div><ul><li>Complex, data-rich applications; mature codebases; the psychology of habit formation; fintech; wellness applications; remote, distributed teams; Continuous Discovery Habits; quantitative and qualitative research best-practices (usability testing, interviews, A/B tests, prototypes, etc.) cross-platform release planning and execution.</li></ul><div><br></div><div><strong>A bit about life at YNAB:</strong></div><div>That’s a super brief intro to what we’re looking for. But first, you need to know if you’ll even like working with us. We’d love to share more about YNAB, and then we’ll get into (many) more details about this role and how to apply.</div><div><br></div><div>YNAB was founded in 2004 and we haven’t taken on any outside funding—we’re established, profitable, and in this for the long haul. We have one overarching requirement when it comes to joining our team: our original <a href="https://www.ynab.com/about-us/core-value-manifesto">Core Value Manifesto</a> has to really click with you. If you’re nodding emphatically while reading it, you’ll probably really like it here, and we can’t wait to hear from you!</div><div><br></div><div>We live our Core Values every day at YNAB, and we mean it when we say we are an equal-opportunity employer. We believe that a diversity of backgrounds, abilities, beliefs, and experiences is critical to our success, and we are passionate about creating a welcoming, supportive, and collaborative environment for all employees. All are encouraged to apply as we continue to grow a smart, hard-working, and diverse team that loves working together to build something that matters.</div><div><br></div><div>We also work really hard, together, to make working at YNAB an amazing experience, and we’re (humbly) proud to have received <a href="https://www.greatplacetowork.com/certified-company/1367344">many of Fortune's "great place to work" awards</a> over the last several years, including #1 two years in a row! We have a team full of truly exceptional people—the kind you’ll be excited to work with. We’d love to introduce you to a few of them!</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Who you’ll be working with:</strong></div><div>We’re talking product management here, so you’ll be working with a lot of different people. We can’t even list them all, really. So we’ll start with a few of your closest collaborators—your fellow product managers in this product group: </div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>Hannah</strong> is the Group Product Manager for the product group you’d be joining, and she’d also be your manager. She loves building empowered, innovative, and trust-filled teams and is deeply invested in helping individuals and communities change their financial narratives and realities. She has a penchant for prepositional phrases and an abiding absorption with acronyms (and alliteration). She’s also a dancer and performing artist, and she does a fantastic British queen accent.</div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>Jacob</strong> loves to work with a cross-functional crew to tackle tough and interesting problems. He’s a fanatic about delightful experiences and is always sitting on the cutting edge of tech—looking out for the newest life-changing app or gadget. When he’s not working, you can find him meditating, reading, eating spicy food, or looking for unique houses on Zillow.</div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>Sarah</strong> thrives on collaboratively tackling complex problems, fostering connection, and making her teammates’ work lives smoother. Originally from Canada’s east coast, she now calls Toronto home. Outside of work, you’ll likely find her exploring nature in and beyond the city, deep in a craft project, or immersed in a sci-fi or fantasy book.</div><div><br></div><div>And as we said above, you’ll also cross paths with—well—probably everyone else. People like <strong>Marlon </strong>and <strong>Christina</strong> (a couple of our developers), <strong>Adam</strong> and <strong>Heidi</strong> (both designers), <strong>Aaron</strong> (our Director of Product), <strong>Eva</strong> (our Data Scientist), <strong>Kody</strong> (a product marketer), and <strong>Erin</strong> (our Curriculum Manager).</div><div><br></div><h1>How You’ll Work at YNAB</h1><div>Still with us? Now that you’ve met some of your potential future teammates, let’s talk more about YNAB as a company. Here’s how we operate:</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Live (Almost) Anywhere You Want</strong></div><div>We’ve always been a fully remote team, and have people all over the world. For this role, you’ll need to be located somewhere between the Pacific Time Zone (UTC-8) and the Central European Time Zone (UTC+1). Proximity doesn’t influence productivity, but it sure does help with communication. Wherever you are, just make sure you have a reliable internet connection—like, a really good one. Please.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Work Four Days a Week</strong></div><div>We’ve adopted a four-day work week (still 100% paid!) and rarely work more than that. There are occasions and seasons where things get busy and people put some extra time in—but then we encourage them to take some extra time off, too. We’re a product-led organization that takes our work-life balance seriously, so we <em>all</em> prioritize working hard and smart, but at a measured pace. We care deeply about what we do, but we also love our families and about 2,000 other things. We have perspective and, ultimately, we think it makes us—and our work—even better.<br><br>
</div><div><strong>Flex Your Work Schedule</strong></div><div>We’re fully remote, so a lot of our work is done asynchronously, but we love working together in real time when it makes sense. We try to schedule most meetings between 12-3 pm Eastern time (16:00-19:00 UTC) Monday-Thursday. Outside of your meetings, we trust you to set your own schedule by balancing your team’s needs with your own needs. You don’t need to ask for permission to take off early one afternoon to see the doctor, or be “active” on Slack if you’re working deeply on a project. We look at what you accomplish—not when or how long you're in front of a computer.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Take Vacation (Seriously)</strong></div><div>We want you to take vacation. In fact, we have a <em>minimum</em> vacation policy of three weeks per year. Five weeks feels about right (plus two extra weeks for our company-wide December Break). It’s important to get plenty of downtime and to get out and do something. We’ll look forward to seeing pictures of your adventures in our #office-wall Slack channel!</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Meet the Team IRL</strong></div><div>Some of our best work (and bonding!) is done in person. You’ll generally have the opportunity to meet with your YNAB teammates at least once a year, at a small-team work-focused meetup or at our company retreat. At the YNAB retreat, we love to catch up on spreadsheets and powerpoints in a Best Western conference room. Just kidding. (It’s actually hard to write that sentence, even knowing it’s a joke.) So far, we’ve gone to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Fs1TN-jrDI">Costa Rica</a>, a <a href="https://www.ynab.com/blog/if-you-feel-guilty-spending-money-youre-doing-it-wrong">gigantic cabin</a> in the mountains, a beach house in the Outer Banks, a ranch in Montana, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=js5pNTDKiZE">Laguna Beach</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/pVxX0SZ9OFs">Palm Springs</a>, and most recently, Cape Cod. We work together, play together, and reinforce the bonds we’ve made as a team and company. Every time we meet up, we leave refreshed, motivated, and excited for the year ahead together.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Up Your Game</strong></div><div>We’re serious about helping you improve your craft. It’s one of our favorite spending categories, and it’s the most important work of our managers. Think conferences, online courses and subscriptions, dedicated time away from work to learn something new… It's really up to you and your manager. We love to see our people grow!</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Other Benefits</strong></div><div>Our team is spread all over the world—mostly in the United States, but also in the UK, Canada, Germany, Brazil, Mexico, and several other countries. Team members who live in the US or UK are set up as employees, and those who live in other countries set themselves up as independent contractors. No matter where you live, you’re eligible for our generous paid family leave, vacation, holidays, and sick time. </div><div><br></div><div>If you’re in the US, we also offer fantastic medical, dental, and vision insurance, where we cover 100% of the premium for you and your family. No need to check your vision, you read that right—100%. (Although if you did need to check your vision, NBD, we’ve got you covered!) We also have a Traditional and Roth 401(k) option, where YNAB matches your contributions up to six percent, and matches vest immediately. (Are you a personal finance junkie like our founder Jesse? He set up YNAB’s 401k to have the lowest fee structure possible, where all plan costs are paid by YNAB, <em>not your retirement nest egg</em>. The investment funds available are fantastic, passively-managed, ultra low-cost index funds. You’re not a PF junkie? Trust us, it’s awesome.) If you’re in the UK, we also contribute six percent to your pension.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>Competitive Compensation</strong></div><div>At YNAB, we’re committed to equitable, market-driven, data-based compensation and we aim to offer a competitive benefits package to our team members. The starting salary for this role will be between $120,000 - $155,000 USD annually (with the top of that range reserved only for the most experienced candidates). If we decide to make you an offer, we’ll determine the most appropriate number based on what we know about your experience and competency for the role, and then we’ll make you our best offer and hope that you accept! If you join our team, you’ll also be eligible for a raise once a year and for our profit-share twice a year. (YNAB wins, you win—that kind of thing.)</div><div><br></div><div><strong>A Few Final Tidbits</strong></div><ul>
<li>Once you start, we DEMAND (in a friendly, ALL CAPS IS YELLING way) that you fill out your “Bucket List” spreadsheet with 50 items. (That’s harder than it sounds!) </li>
<li>We love to celebrate with you when you complete something on your bucket list—AND, we love using your bucket list as inspiration for your best birthday present(s) ever. </li>
<li>We want you firing on all cylinders, so we’ll set you up with a shiny new computer and replace it every three years.  </li>
<li>Did we mention that YNAB makes a huge, positive difference in people’s lives? You may not think that matters much, but then a few months down the road, you’ll realize it’s made your job really, really enjoyable. Don’t underestimate this one!</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div>If this sounds like your ideal environment, read on because now we want to talk about you, and how you’ll play a big part in changing people’s lives.</div><div><br></div><h1>Now back to you, our new Product Manager....</h1><div>Here at YNAB, we believe that good ideas can come from anywhere, so we strive to be cross-functional in all phases of product development. As a Product Manager, you won’t be a gatekeeper or the hub in a hub-and-spoke system—you’ll connect and empower people and ideas, often <em>getting out of the way</em> to enable your colleagues to do their best work. In collaboration with your product teammates and stakeholders across the organization, you’ll help chart and manifest the best path to achieving our company goals through rigorous discovery, rapid experimentation, skillful prioritization, and iterative delivery. Along the way, you’ll encounter a lot of paradoxical truths and part of your job will be to navigate how to move from “either/or” to “yes/and.”</div><div><br></div><div>Product management is inherently messy (and beautifully so), but most of your day-to-day work will fall into one of these buckets:</div><ul>
<li>Determining <strong>what </strong>to work on (and <strong>why</strong>);</li>
<li>Participating in the <strong>how</strong>; </li>
<li>Sharing the responsibility for <strong>execution</strong>; </li>
<li>And acting as the <strong>grease</strong> (not the glue). </li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>To determine what to work on (and why), you’ll:</strong></div><ul>
<li>Become an expert on YNAB’s business and product, the customers we are serving (and the ones we are not), our capabilities, the marketplace, industry trends, and potential disruptions. You’ll do this by synthesizing previously gathered data, opinions, experiences, and history along with conducting your own qualitative and quantitative research. We’ve been around for 20 years but we know that the market is always changing, and the best way to stay in sync with our customers is by speaking with them directly!  </li>
<li>Use your research to refine your team’s priorities, test your assumptions, and validate your hypotheses.</li>
<li>Map the team’s work from a long-term vision (we’re talking years ahead), to all the possible ideas from all the possible sources, to the short-term roadmap of execution: what are we going to build, what are we not going to build, and in what order should we act?</li>
<li>Navigate countless trade-offs (okay, maybe not countless, but hundreds wouldn’t be an exaggeration). Searching for a true win-win is the happiest path, but sometimes constraints are constraints. You know the former from the latter and have the vision and pragmatism to know when to keep digging and when to move on. </li>
<li>Define the key indicators that would show your team is on the right track, as well as the ones that would show the opposite.</li>
<li>Communicate clearly and repeatedly (evangelize!) the value and strategic purpose of the work your product team is delivering.</li>
<li>Be intensely curious. Period.</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>To participate in the “how”, you’ll:</strong></div><ul>
<li>Act as a critical sounding-board for product designers and engineers, articulating the problem to be solved and managing scope throughout both the discovery and delivery phases of product development. You’re not afraid to ask questions and in fact, have a knack for knowing when to ask the right ones to help your team move forward.</li>
<li>Monitor the effort and resources involved in each approach your team considers, always keeping one eye on the future and one eye on the here and now. You have a finely tuned spidey sense for how different work streams will impact each other and you love a good scheme if it means getting more value in the hands of users faster.  </li>
<li>Meet your colleagues where they are—you can speak the languages of engineering and/or product design when needed to evaluate a tradeoff or understand a blocker—and at the end of the day help bring everyone back to the user and their experience. </li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>In sharing the responsibility for execution, you’ll:</strong></div><ul>
<li>Understand that accountability is ultimately shared in our collaborative, cross-functional work—but also be willing and able to provide direction and make decisions when choices are not obvious. (In fact, you love when that happens. You’re the type of person who expounds on decision-making strategies for way too long at summer barbecues, but somehow keeps people listening.)</li>
<li>Take on some project management responsibilities. This isn’t the core of your work, but since you sit in the middle of multiple major information flows, you’ll naturally also facilitate a fair number of process and planning conversations, and keep the trains on the track, so to speak.</li>
<li>Define launch plans, manage release cycles, and conduct retrospectives in collaboration with stakeholders from across the company.</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>In acting as the grease (not the glue), you’ll:</strong></div><ul>
<li>Communicate relentlessly to ensure that your team is aligned and the dots are being connected between the work of your team, the work of other teams, and our overarching strategy.</li>
<li>Collaborate with engineers and product designers (and other stakeholders as needed—you know when to ask for help!) to validate assumptions and weed out bad ideas. You’ll also play a key role in evaluating work-in-progress.</li>
<li>Communicate your team’s roadmap and release timelines to the rest of the organization, especially around high-visibility launches. You are relentless about ensuring that everyone is aligned because you know this clarity allows others to take confident actions.</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div>That’s a whopping sixteen bullets, but let's say that your success as a Product Manager at YNAB fundamentally comes down to this: Your ability to approach product development as holistic, simultaneous, problem-solving of both user and business goals. </div><div><br></div><div>And if we haven’t yet spilled enough metaphorical ink on this idea: We work collaboratively here so you’ll listen to ideas, questions, and critiques from teammates with grace and patience—not because that’s nice, but because you see this as critical to our shared success. That said, you know your stuff and when the rubber hits the road you can both make hard calls and eloquently and logically explain them.</div><div><br></div><h1>How to Apply</h1><div>
<strong>Submit your application (including what’s listed below) by Sunday, March 23rd at 11:59pm PT.</strong> Firm. It’s a real deadline. The kind you love.</div><div><br></div><div><strong>What to include in your application:</strong></div><ul>
<li>
<strong>A resume.</strong> If you don’t have an updated formal resume, that’s fine! An informal overview of your work history and education is all we’re looking for.</li>
<li>
<strong>A cover letter and answers to four specific questions. </strong>But not your typical cover letter. You have our permission to NOT be formal, just help us get to know <em>you</em>. <ul>
<li>
<em>On page 1:</em> We’d love for you to tell us a bit about yourself, what drew you to product management, why you’re interested in this role at YNAB, and why you think you’d be a great fit. </li>
<li>
<em>On page 2 onward: </em>Please answer these four questions:<ul>
<li>1. Tell us about a time when you were initially convinced you were right about something at work, but you changed your mind based on the expertise or opinions of others. Please answer in 1-2 paragraphs. </li>
<li>2. How have you honed your craft as a product manager, and how do you see yourself continuing to develop your skills in the future? Feel free to share specific strategies or frameworks, sources of information or inspiration, and/or your general approach. Please answer in 1-2 paragraphs.</li>
<li>3. Tell us about a time when you realized that you shipped something either A) too early, or B) too late. Did the experience change your approach to product development? How? Please answer in 1-2 paragraphs.</li>
<li>4. Continuing in this vein, show us how you’d communicate this timing mistake to your immediate product squad. Draft a one paragraph message aimed at the squad’s Slack channel explaining the situation and how you plan to address it. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Answers to twelve quick, informational questions</strong>, which you’ll see when you click Apply. These include things like your contact information, location, and relevant experience for the role.</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div><strong>A few tips:</strong></div><ul>
<li>If you meet our hard requirements and follow the application instructions, we promise that a real human will review your materials. With that being said, we hope that you’ll feel free to <strong>be genuinely yourself in your application</strong>; we want to get to know you!</li>
<li>Though we know it’s customary in some areas, please <strong>do not share a headshot</strong> anywhere in your application materials.</li>
<li>You’ll only be able to apply once, so <strong>make sure your answers are final before you click submit</strong>. You can always start your application, and then click the “Save application for later”<strong> </strong>link at the bottom to—you guessed it—finish it up later. (Note: that link <em>will </em>have an expiration date! Check your email for more information if you choose this option.)</li>
<li>Keep an eye out for a confirmation email from @pinpoint.email titled <strong>Thank you for applying to YNAB!</strong>—this means your application has been received successfully. If you don’t receive it, please apply again.</li>
<li>
<strong>Our goal is to make the recruitment and hiring process as accessible as possible</strong>. If we can help you with an accessibility need, email us at accommodations@ynab.com and indicate in the subject line that you’re applying for the Product Manager role. (Please note that we can only respond to messages related to accommodations at this email.)</li>

It’s rigorous, but we also hear that it’s fun (truly!). We enjoy getting to know you throughout, and we make sure you have plenty of chances to get to know us, too. </li>
</ul><div><br></div><div>We’re excited to hear from you!</div><div><br></div><div>P.S. If you’re not interested in this position right now, but know someone who might be, we’d appreciate you passing this along!</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>

<p>
  <strong>Headquarters:</strong> United States

</p>

<div>
<br>Do you want to work for a mission-driven non-profit, managing the cybersecurity of systems that will contribute to helping the livelihoods of millions of coffee farmers around the world? Enveritas is a 501(c)3 non-profit and Y Combinator-backed startup looking to hire an information security lead for our Engineering &amp; Data Group. You can learn more about this job at <a href="https://www.enveritas.org/jobs/infosec/">https://www.enveritas.org/jobs/infosec/</a>
</div><div>
<br>We are looking for an experienced information security lead based out of the EU or United States with a focus on security policy and risk management to join us on a remote work, full-time basis. In this role, you will work as part of the Engineering and Data Group  — a quirky, talented, and humble group of about twenty with diverse backgrounds ranging from journalism to academia to international industry.<br><br>
</div><div><strong>About Our Engineering &amp; Data Group</strong></div><div>
<br>The Engineering &amp; Data Group builds software to collect, analyze, and report data about coffee farmers’ conditions and practices. This large-scale data-collection effort requires many moving parts to work together, and we use technology to support that effort at every step of the process — from identifying coffee farms in satellite imagery, to coordinating survey edits across country teams, to detecting data anomalies in real-time that can be investigated while teams are still in the field. A core part of our work is in data aggregation and report generation, with insights ultimately being shared with roasters and other stakeholders on how to assist in improving the social, economic, and environmental conditions of smallholder farmers. <br><br>
</div><div>While our tooling varies across products, our organization primarily uses Google Workspace for collaborating, and our Engineering &amp; Data Group uses AWS and Google Cloud for running the platforms that power our Impact, Ops, and Partnerships groups. We also use a standard assortment of SaaS platforms.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>What You’ll Be Doing<br></strong><br>
</div><div>You will be responsible for cybersecurity policies and practices, ensuring compliance with cybersecurity frameworks and working across teams to implement security best practices. As a dedicated security specialist, you will work closely with our IT, legal, and engineering teams to assess risks, define policies, and enhance security across the organization.<br><br>
</div><div>Your work will include:</div><ul>
<li>
<strong>Assess and improve security policies and risk posture</strong> by reviewing audits, prioritizing key improvements, and ensuring compliance with best practices.</li>
<li>
<strong>Manage security configurations and access controls</strong> across Google Workspace, AWS/GCP, and SaaS vendors.</li>
<li>
<strong>Lead security operations and incident response</strong>, including monitoring alerts, running tabletop exercises, and implementing MDM, patch management, and Zero Trust initiatives.</li>
<li>
<strong>Drive security awareness and training</strong>, working with internal teams to enhance security practices, refine IAM roles, and strengthen data protection.</li>
<li>
<strong>Support IT operations and system security</strong> – act as a backup for our Head of IT, assisting with access management, IT troubleshooting, and ensuring secure day-to-day operations.</li>
</ul><div><strong>Qualifications</strong></div><div>
<br>Read this first: research shows that people of different backgrounds read job postings differently. If you don’t think you meet all of the qualifications but do think you’d be a great match for us, please consider applying and sharing more in your application. We’d love to talk with you to see what skills you can bring to our team. This said, we are most likely to be interested in your candidacy if you can demonstrate the majority of the qualifications listed below:</div><ul>
<li>5+ years of experience in cybersecurity, IT security, or a related field, with a focus on policy development, risk management, and incident response.</li>
<li>Strong understanding of identity and access management (IAM), data protection, compliance frameworks (e.g., GDPR, SOC 2, ISO 27001), and security operations.</li>
<li>Hands-on experience managing security configurations in Google Workspace, AWS/GCP, and SaaS applications.</li>
<li>Experience developing and implementing security policies, including asset management, risk governance, and third-party risk management.</li>
<li>Strong communication skills and experience collaborating across IT, legal, and engineering teams.</li>
</ul><div><strong>Who You Are</strong></div><div>
<br>Our team is fully distributed, so you should be comfortable with remote work. This role is a full-time individual contributor role. While you can be located anywhere in the United States or European Union regions that our EOR (Deel) supports, note that the core hours for this role are 9 am to 2 pm Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, with flexibility to start earlier or finish later based on your schedule.</div><div>
<br>You should be inspired by our mission to improve the lives of smallholder coffee farmers, and have an interest in sustainability. You should have a deep empathy for users of our tools and understand the importance of supporting the work of other teams. Because operational and business needs can be ambiguous and change on a short time-scale, you should have a love for environments with uncertainty, and enjoy not only solving problems, but discovering and demystifying them.</div><div>
<br>We are a small team! You should be comfortable working both independently and as a thoughtful collaborator, and have experience working in smaller organizations where flexibility and adaptability are keys to success.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>About Working With Us &amp; Compensation<br></strong><br>
</div><div>Enveritas has teams around the world: we are about 100 people spread over almost two dozen countries, and of all backgrounds, faiths, and identities. To learn more about working at Enveritas, see <a href="https://www.enveritas.org/jobs/">https://www.enveritas.org/jobs/<br></a><br>

<p>
  <strong>Headquarters:</strong> Atlanta, GA, USA
    <br /><strong>URL:</strong> <a href="https://relaycommerce.io">https://relaycommerce.io</a>
</p>

<div><strong>About the Company</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Relay Commerce is an e-commerce enablement platform offering scaling solutions across personalized messaging, social commerce, and customer retention, helping merchants navigate the rapidly evolving digital landscape with a comprehensive suite of tools. The Relay suite of solutions currently drives more than $1 billion in aggregate incremental gross merchandise volume for more than 35,000 merchants.</div><div><br></div><div>The Relay ecosystem currently consists of eight software products that accelerate merchant revenue growth through email marketing automation, on-page conversion optimization, user generated content management, retention analytics, and subscription management. Relay’s suite of products are established as key revenue generation tools for innovative e-commerce merchants worldwide.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><strong>About the Role</strong></div><div><br></div><div>Engineering Managers at Relay are accountable for the technical and delivery output of the engineering teams they help run. The role is split into three pillars; people, product and technical leadership.</div><div><br></div><div>Collaborating widely with all appropriate stakeholders, you will help our teams ship great work that really matters to our customers, to a high technical standard.</div><div><br></div><div>Engineering Managers must be exceptional technical communicators; you must be able to understand, articulate and explore potential features and technical challenges.</div><div>
<strong><br>Primary Responsibilities<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Being accountable for delivery across the teams that you manage; ensuring teams are working at an effective, sustainable pace.</li>
<li>Ensuring that your team members are performing at (or reach) a high bar of technical ability. You are accountable for the performance and growth of the engineers on your teams.</li>
<li>Partner with both product and technical team members to help define, communicate and prioritize upcoming work.This involves a lot of communication and technical writing.</li>
<li>Lead two teams of between 6-10 engineers in total, and support, coach and develop them with regular 1:1’s and continuous feedback.</li>
<li>Remember the human; realize each team member has their own perspectives, needs, wants, challenges and frustrations. Work to understand them - and help them grow - as individuals.</li>
<li>Maintain your technical knowledge; although you will never be working in the “line of delivery”, you should plan to spend 10-20% of your time working on technical tasks on the products that you oversee.</li>
<li>Provide actionable insights into how to approach larger technical tasks – although you defer to team members first.</li>
<li>Partner with the Head of Engineering; working closely with them to deliver company-wide policies, objectives, processes and standards.</li>
</ul><div>
<strong><br>Important Traits for Success<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>
<strong>Comfortable with ambiguity; </strong>larger objectives rarely start fully-formed. You will have a high degree of autonomy to help us clearly define those objectives.</li>
<li>
<strong>Team-oriented;</strong> You measure your success by the achievements and growth of those you lead. You “play well with others”. You trust your team to solve problems; you give clear guidance and then “let go of the vine” and let them deliver.</li>
<li>
<strong>Strategic thinker; </strong>You can balance immediate needs with a long-term vision, ensuring sustainable product growth.</li>
<li>
<strong>Outcome-focused; </strong>You assess outcomes, not processes. You guide teams towards making the highest impact.</li>
<li>
<strong>Strong sense of ownership;</strong> You do what needs to be done for success; you take pride in your work and are committed to delivering high-quality, impactful solutions.</li>
</ul><div>
<strong><br>Required Expertise<br></strong><br>
</div><ul><li>You are expected to have recently worked in a hands-on role at a senior level. Whilst you will not be working on features or bugs off a teams backlog (i.e. not part of their velocity), you are expected to develop and maintain a high level of technical knowledge about the applications your team members work on.</li></ul><div>
<strong><br>Technical<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Significant, proven, senior-level experience with full-stack JavaScript frameworks, working across both frontend and backend systems. Our guidance is <strong>7+ years at senior level. </strong>
</li>
<li>Strong experience with PostgreSQL, MySQL or other RDBMS.</li>
<li>Experience with observability tools, their value and how best to use them e.g. using the Golden Signals.</li>
<li>Previous experience working in e-commerce.</li>
<li>Highly desirable: Experience running containers on AWS/GCP (and experience with cloud infrastructure platforms as a whole).</li>
<li>Highly desirable: Experience with e-commerce marketplaces such as Shopify and WooCommerce.</li>
</ul><div>
<strong><br>Leadership<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Proven experience growing, leading and managing engineering team members.</li>
<li>Able to provide input on, understand and challenge engineering decisions.</li>
<li>Natural ability to inspire and motivate a team.</li>
</ul><div>
<strong><br>Product<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Delivery experience; you have defined and shipped major initiatives as part of a team.</li>
<li>Excellent written and verbal communication skills; you can write clear and succinct explanations of technical topics for a variety of audiences.</li>
</ul><div>
<strong><br>Education<br></strong><br>
</div><ul><li>Highly desirable: Bachelors or Masters degree</li></ul><div>
<strong><br>The Interview Process<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>
<strong>Initial call (30 minutes)</strong>. You’ll speak with our People team, who will ask about your previous roles &amp; experience leading engineering team members. They’ll be able to help you understand Relay as a company, too, and check you meet our minimum requirements.</li>
<li>
<strong>First round (30 minutes)</strong> - You’ll speak with the Head of Engineering, briefly discussing your previous roles and experience again. They’ll be interested to hear examples from your previous experience about how you’ve shaped the products you’ve worked on, and how you’ve shipped complex things.</li>
<li>
<strong>Technical assessment (variable, and up to you) - </strong>We would like you to demonstrate your senior level of technical experience; we do have a take home assessment, which is our default for all engineering team members at Relay - but you tell us how you would like us to assess you here.</li>
</ul><div>a) Providing us code samples / open source work you’ve done in the past is an option, as is a live pairing exercise on a call, using your tools, environment and language.</div><ul>
<li>
<strong>Second round(1 hour) </strong>- You’ll meet with our Chief Technology Officer and Head of Engineering, and discuss your technical assessment first (we might even ask you how you prefer to assess engineering ability during interviews!) and then move on to more specific questions about your skills and experience in technical areas.</li>
<li>
<strong>Third round</strong> (<strong>1 hour</strong>) - You’ll meet with our Chief Executive Officer, Ricardo Hinds, who (at present) leads our Product function across all Relay BU’s - and perhaps another leadership team member. They will focus primarily on your ability to set teams up with clear guidance on what to build (and why it’s important), but you should expect other, more general questions here too.</li>
</ul><div>
<strong><br>Benefits &amp; Perks<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Work From Home Stipend</li>
<li>Therapy/Mental Health Reimbursement</li>
<li>Paid Parental Leave</li>
<li>Flexible Time Off</li>
<li>Annual Company Offsite</li>
<li>Co-working Space Allowance</li>
<li>Company Swag</li>
</ul><div>Relay Commerce is an equal opportunity employer. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all team members.</div>

</p>

<h1>The Company: </h1><div>Our mission is to make education affordable by helping institutions increase alumni giving. The idea started from our founders’ struggle with the lack of scholarships when they were students. Watch this TEDx talk from Kalyan to learn more. <br> <br>We are a bootstrapped company that has grown to be a leader in the alumni software space in the US. We’re slated for even faster growth on the path to becoming market leaders through a unique strategic partnership with Blackbaud (read more here &amp; here) <br> <br>Our customers are universities and high schools and in most cases, we’re working with staff in the alumni relations and fundraising office at these institutions. The value prop for them at a high level is simple - “Engage more alumni and raise more money from them”. 90%+ of our customers are from the US currently but we’re starting sales in UK and Canada this year so we’ll start to see some more customer regions this year. Our team is based in India and the USA. The India team is based in Bangalore and the US team is fully remote. <br> <br>Impact so far: </div><ul>
<li>10M+ million alumni connected </li>
<li>1M+ students impacted </li>
<li>$50M+ donations facilitated </li>
<li>100M+ engagement opportunities created </li>
<li>#1 Alumni management software in the US (G2Crowd)</li>
</ul><div><br></div><h1>The Opportunity: </h1><div>Almabase is looking to hire a Account Executive to close new sales. In this role, your goal is to help universities &amp; high schools understand how to grow their donor pool using Almabase. You will be handed marketing-qualified leads that are generated through various inbound &amp; outbound, Cross Sell, and partner channels. You will be responsible for handling that relationship until they sign a contract. Once they sign a contract, customer success will take over and help them succeed. <br> <br>While most of the sales happen remotely over Zoom, you will also have opportunities to represent the company at various conferences around the US along with meeting potential customers and selling in person. <br> <br>While a majority of our team is based in India, most of our AEs are based in the US. We are looking for someone located in the US for this role too. <strong>This is a remote job and you can work from anywhere in the US, but from 8 am to 5 pm EST.</strong> <br> <br><br>
</div><h1>Benefits: </h1><ul>
<li>Insurance: Medical, dental, and vision coverage, with the option to insure dependents/family members at a reasonable cost (Reimbursed through QSEHRA program) </li>
<li>Work from anywhere in the US </li>
<li>Unlimited vacation. Yes, you heard it right! </li>
<li>Stock options after 12 months, based on performance </li>
<li>Opportunity for accelerated growth to Sr. Account Executive (read below)</li>
</ul><div><br></div><h1>Salary: </h1><ul>
<li>$125k OTE ($75k base + $50k on-target commissions) </li>
<li>Commissions Uncapped (one of our AEs hit 200% OTC last year) </li>
<li>Annual Quota: $1.25M total contract value (TCV) (Translates to roughly $415k - 460k ARR) </li>
<li>Most of our customer contracts are three year contracts and include a one-time implementation/setup fee. The total contract value is calculated as the total revenue for the company from that contract over the three years including non-recurring fees. </li>
<li>Commission rate: 5% of total contract value (TCV). Accelerates to 7.5% TCV in each quarter you achieve over quota ($312k TCV)</li>
</ul><div><br></div><h1>Why should you join Almabase in this role? </h1><div>Educational institutions are not the easiest to sell to. But that’s what makes this experience challenging and unique. Over the years we have developed some of the best practices in our sales motions. <br> <br>In this role, you will get to build on your skills and establish yourself as a successful salesperson. Given the relatively small team, you can have an outsized impact. Knowing that the work you do every day improves access to education for millions of students is highly motivating - it’s what keeps us going too. <br> <br><br>
</div><h1>Key Responsibilities: </h1><ul>
<li>KPIs - $ revenue closed won, opportunity to closed-won conversion rate, contributions to pipeline through conferences. </li>
<li>Handle qualification calls for new marketing qualified leads - Identify if the prospect’s BANT (Budget, Authority, Need, &amp; Timing) are in line with our expectations. It’s critical to empathize with the prospect and make sure their goals are aligned with our service. </li>
<li>Handle product demos for sales-qualified leads - Show them how Almabase can solve their challenges and achieve their goals. You’ll also present pricing, according to their requirements. </li>
<li>Handle all further conversations from product questions to contract negotiations after an opportunity is created to eventually close the deal and hand it over to the customer success team. </li>
<li>Nurture all the marketing qualified leads in your pipeline with high-quality follow-ups. </li>
<li>You will be supported by the rest of the team whenever you need assistance. Eg: if there are deep technical questions, a Solutions Consultant will join the call with you. The SC will handle the questions about the product roadmap on the call. If you need help with negotiating a contract, the VP of Sales will join the call with you. </li>
<li>Identify insights and pain points from conversations with prospects, and contribute to the product roadmap by providing active feedback to the product team. </li>
<li>You are not required to develop your own pipeline, our DemandGen team will create most of the pipeline for you to close. However, we expect AEs to bring in at least 10% of their pipeline themselves through conferences that they attend. </li>
<li>You are required to work closely with partner organizations in co-selling opportunities. This is a key part of your job. </li>
</ul><div><br></div><h1>Requirements: </h1><div>
<strong>Must have skills:</strong> </div><ul>
<li>2-3 years of experience in either: <ul>
<li>B2B software sales (deal closing) to mid-market/enterprise customers in the nonprofit/education space. <strong>OR</strong> </li>
<li>Fundraising/Major Gifts experience in nonprofit or higher education institutions, managing and closing large donor commitments. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> Proven track record of closing deals/gifts above $20K+ (ARR for AEs or Major Gifts for MGOs). </li>
<li>Strong ability to build and nurture long-term relationships with decision-makers and stakeholders. </li>
<li>Excellent presentation and communication skills, with experience handling high-stakes conversations. </li>
<li>Ability to learn quickly – whether it’s a new product, sales methodology, or understanding institutional needs. </li>
<li>Familiarity with CRMs such as HubSpot (for sales professionals) or donor/fundraising platforms (for fundraising professionals). </li>
<li>Experience attending conferences and networking events to generate pipeline or donor prospects. </li>
<li>Comfortable working in a metrics-based environment. </li>
<li>Prior experience negotiating contracts (for sales professionals) or donor agreements (for fundraising professionals). </li>
</ul><div> <br><strong>Good to have skills: </strong>
</div><ul>
<li> Exposure to solution selling or consultative sales methodology. </li>
<li> Ability to effectively leverage AI tools while applying sound judgment and contextualization. </li>
</ul><div> </div><h1>How would your 1 year at Almabase look like? </h1><div><strong>In 3 Months: </strong></div><ul>
<li> In your first quarter, you'll receive clear targets that outline the number of new deals to close and revenue to add. You’ll immerse yourself in our lead prioritization process to establish and nurture a robust pipeline. Every quarter, you'll continue leveraging and refining the strategies from previous periods. </li>
<li> You’ll actively participate in weekly deal reviews with the VP of Sales to discuss tactics, address challenges, and refine your approach for better closings. </li>
<li> Expect to attend 1-2 industry conferences per quarter, spreading across the US, to build your network and learn best practices in our competitive landscape. </li>
</ul><div> <br><strong>In 6 Months: </strong>
</div><ul>
<li> Building on the work from the previous quarter, you’ll continue executing high-value tasks and refining your approach based on past learnings. Your focus on prioritizing high-potential leads will further drive your success. </li>
<li> You’ll play a role in setting up the next quarter’s targets and strategy, using your experiences and insights to refine our approach. </li>
<li> Hitting key revenue milestones could secure you a $25K OTE increase and a title bump to Sr. Account Executive, a fast-track recognition for high performance. </li>
</ul><div> <br><strong>In 12 Months: </strong>
</div><ul>
<li> You’ll be a key contributor to shaping our sales strategy. Collaborate with leadership to fine-tune goals and drive broader revenue initiatives. </li>
<li> Beyond the initial title bump, your career trajectory at Almabase is built on merit, with the potential for additional advancement as you continue to drive significant revenue growth. </li>
</ul><div> </div><h1>What will make you successful in this role? </h1><ul>
<li>First and foremost, you need to be good at building rapport with prospects. Relationship building is very critical to be successful as a salesperson in this market. Your prospects need to first trust you before buying anything from you. </li>
<li> You need to get really good at solution selling. Our product is not a commodity with simple features. You need to be able to connect the prospect’s needs, wear a consultant’s hat, and provide the right solution to them. That’s half the sale. You need to develop a good enough understanding of the product and the market to be effective at this. </li>
<li> You need patience but you need to be proactive in nurturing the prospect to succeed in this role, it pays well to be patient in this role </li>
<li> You need to be resilient, be ready to face rejections, and still keep going. Without an intrinsic motivation to perform well and constantly improve, this is a hard job. It will take time to succeed. </li>
<li> You need to be disciplined and good at multi-tasking. When you have many deals in your pipeline at any time, prioritization &amp; context switching become critical skills. Otherwise, it’s easy to get overwhelmed. </li>
<li> How did we do in 2024: <ul>
<li> We hit our ambitious sales goals </li>
<li> We closed more enterprise deals than previous years combined </li>
<li> AEs hit president’s club - Hawaii here we come! </li>
<li> Closed one of our biggest deal in company’s history on the last day of the year. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul><div> </div><h1>How will we set you up for success in this role? </h1><ul>
<li>We will provide you with detailed training to give you a head start in the world of alumni relations and educational fundraising. We’ll also talk about our positioning, the competitive landscape, provide you access to hundreds of recorded conversations, and existing marketing materials. Our CRM is a treasure trove :) </li>
<li> We will find an opportunity to bring you to India to bond with the larger team and build relationships to help you be successful in this role. </li>
<li> We will provide you with in-depth training into our product along with sandbox access to let you play around. The focus is for you to figure out how each piece helps toward solving the puzzle for customers. </li>
<li> We’ll walk you through our current sales playbook and sales enablement materials. We’ll also do a deep dive on competitors and handling other objections, along with role plays to get you prepared. </li>
<li> During the first 4 weeks, you will be invited to shadow plenty of sales calls just to listen in and understand how we go about sales currently. We believe everybody will learn different things from this process but it has worked very effectively in the past. </li>
<li> We will have a weekly sync up with the rest of the GTM team (SDRs, Marketing, etc.) to stay aligned and understand overall growth goals. </li>
<li> You will have a quarterly 1:1 review with the Sales Director to discuss your career goals and overall success, apart from regular mentoring. </li>
<li> We will provide you access to the best SaaS sales resources and add you to a few SaaS sales communities so you can discuss with other people in similar roles - learn and teach at the same time. We’ve found that this is the fastest way to improve your skills. </li>
<li> Most importantly, we will help you set up a one-on-one casual chat with members of different functions of the Almabase team, so you get to know everyone well. </li>
</ul><div> If all of this sounds exciting to you, join us for an exciting and fulfilling ride at Almabase.</div>

</div><div>
<br>In this role, you’ll work on a variety of client projects to find cost-effective, high-quality, pragmatic solutions to complex problems. Responsibilities will include:<br><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Crafting technical architecture plans through interfacing with clients to understand product requirements</li>
<li>Developing and optimizing technical solutions while keeping in mind performance, scalability, maintainability, and cost-effectiveness</li>
<li>Participating in code reviews, providing constructive feedback to teammates and ensuring adherence to best practices</li>

<div>
<br>We are looking for a dedicated and passionate Senior Product Manager who knows what it takes to scale up a product used by millions of users worldwide.</div><div>
<br>The salary for this position is €75,000 annually, with yearly increases based on performance and participation in the company-wide performance-based bonus plan.<br><br>
</div><div>You can work from anywhere, as long as your regular working hours naturally align with all European time zones.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong><br>About the Team<br></strong><br>
</div><div>We are a global team of 130+ awesome people working from over 40 countries. We hire globally, you work locally—in the heart of London, a beach outside of Rio de Janeiro, or a quiet village near Florence, the choice is yours. Every few months, we travel to meet up somewhere in the world and spend quality time together. We place a huge amount of trust in our people, and we measure outcomes rather than hours worked. <a href="https://toggl.com/culture/">Our values</a> fuel our results.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong><br>The Role<br></strong><br>
</div><div>As a Senior Product Manager, you will play a key role in a cross-functional team focused on scalability, efficiency, and enabling cross-product functionality.</div><div>
<br>Your main responsibilities will be:</div><ul>
<li>Defining product strategy and direction by balancing business goals, technical feasibility, and user needs, ensuring alignment with the company’s evolving focus.</li>
<li>Driving cross-functional collaboration: working closely with engineers, designers, and stakeholders to translate insights into actionable, high-impact product decisions.</li>
<li>Taking ownership of problem discovery, gathering user feedback, and synthesising insights to build solutions that deliver measurable business impact.</li>
<li>Navigating technical trade-offs—not by defining technical solutions, but by understanding constraints, engaging in strategic discussions, and working with engineers to find the best path forward.</li>
<li>Prioritising scalability and integrations to support enterprise-level functionality while ensuring infrastructure investments translate into meaningful user-facing improvements.</li>
<li>Championing a hands-on, MVP mindset, iterating quickly, validating ideas, and taking decisive action based on feedback and data.</li>
</ul><div>
<strong><br>About You<br></strong><br>
</div><div>You will fit in well with our team if you:</div><ul>
<li>Have experience in B2B SaaS, with a focus on infrastructure, integrations, or platform scalability.</li>
<li>Are highly proactive, engaging, and take ownership: you question assumptions, challenge ideas (including your own), and confidently stand by decisions after thoughtful discussions and research.</li>
<li>Understand PLG principles and know how to apply them in a strategic, data-informed way. You are able to balance this with the data team’s goal of enabling Toggl’s upmarket expansion.</li>
<li>Are a strategic thinker who can translate high-level business goals into actionable plans and prioritise effectively.</li>
<li>Can work collaboratively with engineers to navigate technical challenges, balancing feasibility with business and user impact.</li>
<li>Thrive in ambiguity and act with confidence: you don’t wait for direction but drive forward discussions, make decisions, and adapt as new insights emerge.</li>
<li>Value transparency, openness, and agency: you ask the right questions, seek clarity, and push initiatives forward independently.</li>
<li>Have excellent written and verbal English communication skills.</li>
</ul><div>
<br>This role is perfect for someone who thrives in an evolving environment, enjoys solving complex product challenges at scale, and is excited about shaping the future of Toggl’s cross-product functionality.<br><br>
</div><div><strong>Benefits</strong></div><ul>
<li>Freedom to choose when and how much you work - we only measure results</li>
<li>24 days of paid time off a year, plus your local holidays</li>

<strong>Who We Are<br></strong><br>
</div><div>We're a scrappy, ambitious startup on a mission to empower the next generation of thinkers and writers through cutting-edge generative AI. We don't just build; we innovate, we experiment, and we have fun doing it. We're big on using open-source tech and contributing back when it makes sense. If you're looking to join a team that knows when to work  and when to sweat the details, we're your people.</div><div>
<br><strong>Who You Are<br></strong><br>
</div><div>You're a tech adventurer with at least 5 years of experience who can write killer code, crack a joke, and doesn't break into a cold sweat when someone says "git rebase." You know when to move fast, when to slow down, and - if not - you're willing to learn the difference. If you find generative AI coding assistants amusingly dumb in the wrong hands but jaw-droppingly powerful in the right ones—come on in.</div><div>
<br><strong>What You Bring to the Table<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>
<strong>Languages:</strong> Proficiency in Ruby/Ruby on Rails is essential. Bonus points if you can tango with JavaScript/TS, Python, Go, Rust, or Zig.</li>
<li>
<strong>Web App Mastery:</strong> You get the web stack: from HTTP/TCP to Websockets, HTML, HTMX, and enough CSS to not break things.</li>
<li>
<strong>ORM Savvy:</strong> You can use one, but you're happier slinging SQL yourself.</li>
<li>
<strong>UI/UX Sense:</strong> You appreciate good design, even if your idea of a palette is "light mode or dark mode?"</li>
<li>
<strong>Git Ninja:</strong> You know your way around git rebase and git merge without needing a counselor.</li>
<li>
<strong>Fast Learner:</strong> You're excited to play with shiny new tech and can get shit done without needing a babysitter.</li>
<li>
<strong>Team Player:</strong> You'll work closely with our experienced CTO, soaking up knowledge and contributing your own wizardry.</li>
</ul><div>
<strong>Bonus Points if You<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Have dabbled with LLMs, training models, or Agentic workflows</li>
<li>Understand that "scrappy" isn't just a dog—it's a way of life</li>
<li>Think contributing to open source isn't just cool; it's the right thing to do</li>
</ul><div>
<strong>What You'll Be Doing<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Collaborating with the CTO to build, optimize, and scale core products</li>
<li>Writing robust, maintainable code across our stack</li>
<li>Engaging in building and fine-tuning workflows that may involve generative AI pipelines</li>
<li>Innovating within our open-source-first ecosystem and making meaningful contributions back</li>
<li>Balancing the act of moving fast vs. being careful (sometimes on the same day)</li>
</ul><div>
<strong>Why You'll Love Working With Us<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>
<strong>Ground Floor Vibes:</strong> Early-stage startup with room to grow and learn</li>
<li>
<strong>Flexibility:</strong> Work where you're most productive</li>
<li>
<strong>A Fun Bunch:</strong> We mean business but aren't afraid to crack a joke</li>
<li>
<strong>Tech Playground:</strong> We don't just use the latest tech; we experiment and build it</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div>
<strong>Ready to Join?<br></strong><br>
</div><div>Shoot us your resume, GitHub link, or whatever you think shows off your skills. If you've got a portfolio of side projects or an open-source contribution you're proud of, show it off!</div><div><br></div><div>We're excited to build with you. No egos, no nonsense—just great code, hard work, and some fun along the way.</div><div>

<div><strong>About Us</strong></div><div>
<a href="https://close.com/">Close</a> is a bootstrapped, profitable, 100% remote, ~100 person team of thoughtful individuals who value autonomy and impact. We’re eager to make a product our customers fall in love with over and over again.<br><br>
</div><div>We ❤️ small scaling businesses. Since 2013, we’ve been building a CRM that focuses on better communication, without the hassle of manual data entry or a complex UI. We are out to supercharge sales productivity with the most modern, thoughtfully all-in-one, AI-powered, and communication-focused CRM.<br><br>
</div><div>Our app’s frontend is a single-page TypeScript web app mostly written in React (originally built with Backbone.js). Our mobile app is built using React Native. We bundle with Vite and target only modern browsers. We test with Vitest, React Testing Library, Playwright, and Chromatic (VRT). Our UI updates in near real-time and is styled via CSS modules and takes advantage of fun technologies like Websockets and WebRTC.<br><br>
</div><div>We care about performance (e.g. route-based code splitting or skeleton UI), maintainability, and testability of our frontend code. Our product development process is inspired by <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">Shape Up</a>. We sweat the UI/UX details and work collaboratively with the Product team throughout the design process. This means diving into lo-fi wireframes, and communicating continuously when those ideas are brought to life using Figma and code (Storybook).<br><br>
</div><div>Our frontend app is built on top of our REST API &amp; GraphQL endpoints. Our backend <a href="https://stackshare.io/close-crm/close">tech stack</a> consists of Python/Flask, MongoDB, Postgres, Elasticsearch, and Redis. We run our services in Docker on AWS.<br><br>
</div><div>We ❤️ open sourcing our code and ideas on <a href="https://github.com/closeio">our GitHub</a> and on <a href="https://making.close.com/">The Making of Close</a>, our behind-the-scenes Product &amp; Engineering blog.

<a href="https://close.com/">Close</a> is a bootstrapped, profitable, 100% remote, ~100 person team of thoughtful individuals who prioritize taking ownership and making a meaningful impact. We’re eager to make a product our customers fall in love with over and over again.</div><div><br></div><div>We 💛 small scaling businesses. Since 2013, we’ve been building a CRM that focuses on better communication, without the hassle of manual data entry or a complex UI. We are out to supercharge sales productivity with the most modern, thoughtfully designed, all-in-one, communication-focused CRM. </div><div><br></div><div>Our backend <a href="https://stackshare.io/close-crm/close">tech stack</a> consists primarily of Python Flask web apps with our <a href="https://github.com/closeio/tasktiger">TaskTiger</a> scheduler handling many of the backend asynchronous task processing chores. Our data stores include MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, and Redis. The underlying infrastructure runs on AWS using a combination of managed services like EKS, MSK, RDS and ElasticCache and non-managed services running on EC2 instances. We have CI/CD pipelines that build Docker images, run automated tests and deploy to Kubernetes clusters. We also use these images in our local development environment allowing coding locally against all of our services. We have a well-documented <a href="https://developer.close.com/">public API</a> that is consumed by our front-end JavaScript app as well as numerous integrations. Our infrastructure is heavily automated using Terraform, Ansible and other AWS tools.</div><div><br></div><div>Our product development process is inspired by <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">Shape Up</a>.

<br><br>
</div><div><strong>Introduction</strong></div><div>
<br><br>
</div><div>Elite Software Automation (ESA) is a boutique consulting firm that helps successful, fast growing businesses become even more successful by increasing their profit margin, and enabling scalable growth through process optimization, custom systems, and automations.</div><div><br></div><div>Our clients are established 7 and 8 figure enterprises with service-intensive business models. They are companies who are good at getting clients and making sales, but as they scale, they face challenges in running the back-end of their businesses. They generally have issues with the effectiveness and efficiency of operational processes, systems that should run those processes, and automations, or the lack of them.</div><div><br></div><div>This is where we come in. We turn our client businesses from chaos to order and transform their operations into more lean, more profitable, and more automated machines.<br><br>
</div><div>We fix process issues by expertly designing and implementing all-round detailed business processes that assure effective and efficient operation in any all relevant business area.<br><br>
</div><div>We build and implement custom systems that make sure that all these processes are correctly and efficiently run at all times; and cannot be sabotaged by people, wrong decisions, lack of information, or any other form of human error.<br><br>
</div><div>We automate all processes with repetitive logic within our systems with highly detailed custom automations, removing the manual effort on them, and making execution instant.<br><br>
</div><div>This is only possible because of our unique approach, which consists of focused and methodical execution, dedicated focus on each client's specific business goals and circumstances, extreme attention to detail, and in-house developed technology stack and methodology. Our firm does not outsource anything, everything is done by our full-time in-house team, which includes our expert business process re-engineering team and a full-stack technical design and development team.<br><br>
</div><div>We are selective both regarding clients and team members.<br><br>
</div><div>We vet our prospective clients and work with only mature businesses for whom our services will make a real difference. We ensure that our methodology is always followed and our clients agree to work with it. It is a cooperative client relationship where we focus on the our clients' business results and also help them define how to achieve these results.</div><div><br></div><div>You won't take system requirements from clients or waste time writing useless reports in this job.</div><div><br></div><div>You'll go in, and you'll support your clients with advice, direction, and solution recommendations for their business goals and problems. And you'll execute these recommendations and oversee the implementation into reality.<br><br>
</div><div>If you get this job, your responsibility is to actually improve the client's day-to-day business operation to make them more efficient, more effective, less error-prone, more scalable, and more profitable. You will need to study their business processes, you will need to re-engineer these processes, and you will need to implement these new processes with our custom systems and automations solutions, and then you will need to keep refining the business processes to maximize the results and support our client's business for the long term.<br><br>

You will be responsible for the client's business processes and continuous improvements to their day-to-day business operations.</div><div><br></div><div>When you get a new client, it will be your responsibility to thoroughly investigate the client's day-to-day operations and reconstruct the client's current business processes. You will examine all their current systems, data, records, documents, communication logs, and other artifacts of their business. You will interview all their key staff, managers, and other individuals. You will conduct other investigation as appropriate. And you will ultimately reconstruct in detail the client's current as-is business processes, capturing all appropriate process scenarios, structure, and other inner workings of the business processes.</div><div><br></div><div>You will then use your business process expertise to improve the client's business processes in a way that will enable a more profitable, efficient, and scalable business. You will craft individualized custom solutions and not be boxed in to any cookie-cutter solutions. You will actually work from root principles to find out sub-optimialities and issues in current business processes and then re-engineer the business processes of the client and define the exact desired processes that will need to be implemented to achieve the results goals, and it will be your responsibility to ensure that the desired processes you engineer will actually be able to successfully work in our client's day-to-day business operations.</div><div><br></div><div>You will then work with our technical team to get a systems solution designed that will actually implement, enforce, and automate the desired to-be processes in the client's business. While it is the technical team who is responsible for the technical side of the design, you will work with them to ensure that the design meets the business needs and enables the implementation of the desired business processes. It is also your responsibility to ensure that as the systems are built and made ready for implementation, that they meet the needs of implementing the desired processes you defined and will work for the client's day-to-day business.<br><br>
</div><div>You will then lead the implementation of these processes and systems into the client's actual business operations, and make them the client's new day-to-day reality. You will discover issues during implementation, you will discover the need to refine your improvements, and you will need to follow through on those needs. Ultimately, the actual end-to-end day-to-day resulting operations in the client's business are your responsibility and you will need to work to make sure these processes and systems powering them are refined to achieve the desired results. As our clients evolve their businesses you will need to continue to evolve their processes and systems to power their growth, efficiency, and profitability as time goes on.</div><div><br></div><div>This is an extremely rigorous and thorough job. A very methodical approach is required to execute it. There is a lot of complicated decision making and responsibility in this job, and while there is a lot of independence offered in the job, there also is a great expectation of responsibility and you will be held to account for results on a frequent and regular basis. This job requires a 100% full-time focus and 100% full-time effort. It is impossible to execute this job while doing other things on the side. You should only apply to this job if you are eager to commit to it and to work very hard to deliver exceptional results. Your performance and your career progression within the company will be evaluated by these results and they will not be easy to achieve.</div><div>
