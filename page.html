  <strong>Headquarters:</strong> Philadelphia, PA

<div>
<strong><br>Backend Engineering Consultant<br></strong><br>
</div><div>Fully Remote | Part Time | Equity Based<br><br>
</div><div><br></div><div>
<strong>Roles and Responsibilities:<br></strong><br>
</div><div>The Backend Engineering Consultant will take requirements directly from the CTO, and independently design and develop robust, production grade solutions. This is an individual contributor role. The Engineer will be focused exclusively on design and development, not mentorship, cross training or management. Primary responsibilities include:<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Develop Microservices using Python<br></strong><br>
</div><div>Our primary language is Python, and our API framework is FastAPI. The Engineer will spend much of their time designing, developing and extending Python modules to power the core logic of our graph.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Create and Deploy Containers using Docker and GH Actions<br></strong><br>
</div><div>We take a container-first approach, leveraging Docker to encapsulate our products for deployment to cloud infrastructure. We use GitHub Actions for CI/CD to target infrastructure such as ECR. The Engineer will create Dockerfiles and GH workflow files to define the necessary environment for each application and deploy it.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Create Infrastructure Across Cloud Providers using IaC<br></strong><br>
</div><div>Our product is intended to be used across all major cloud providers, e.g. AWS, GCP, Azure. As such, we leverage Terraform to declaratively define services across providers. You will create Terraform scripts which are capable of creating and manipulating infrastructure with complex configurations, across providers.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong><br>Requirements:<br></strong><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Education and Relevant Experience<br></strong><br>
</div><div>M.S. or B.S. in a S.T.E.M. or quantitative field is highly preferred, however, it is not required. Relevant experience with proven contributions is the highest indicator of potential for success in our opinion. We’ll look for 10+ years in a range of job titles or roles that overlap with the Roles and Responsibilities section. A clean GitHub demonstrating related skills is most important. However, we understand that many professionals don’t have time to create or contribute to public facing repositories, so we encourage applications from Engineers without a robust portfolio.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Deliverable, Cost and Quality Mindset<br></strong><br>
</div><div>danzek.ai™ is a startup, as such, we must be extremely focused on balancing time, cost and quality. The Engineer will need to select libraries and services that are cheap, yet effective. The Engineer will also need to design solutions which are extensible and carefully selected regarding scope. Lastly, the Engineer will be expected to mitigate tech debt at all costs by focusing on best practices, modern patterns and careful implementation.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Trust and Integrity<br></strong><br>
</div><div>As a startup, our IP is extremely valuable. We expect the Engineer to keep our code and designs secret, treating them with the utmost care from an InfoSec perspective. We’re offering the Engineer equity, as such, they have a tangible interest in protecting their ownership.<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Flexibility<br></strong><br>
</div><div>As a consultant, the Engineer may work on days and times that are most convenient for them, and performance will be based upon contributions, not hours worked. We also don’t measure performance in KPIs such as a SLOC, which are often decoupled from quality and tangible benefits.<br><br>

<p>
  <strong>Headquarters:</strong> USA
    <br /><strong>URL:</strong> <a href="https://www.subscript.com">https://www.subscript.com</a>
</p>

<div>The basics<br><br>
</div><ul>
<li>The <strong>stack</strong>: Postgres, Node.js/Express.js, React. Currently running on Heroku, eventually AWS</li>
<li>The <strong>product</strong>: We're building the ultimate suite for Finance teams to manage everything from billing to revenue recognition to subscription metrics, and much more</li>
<li>The <strong>way we work</strong>:<ul>
<li>This is a <strong>remote job</strong> - work anywhere you want, and in any timezone on earth (or outside earth, whatever).</li>
<li>We are an <strong>asynchronous</strong> team - we don't do scheduled meetings, and rely on each team member to pick their own schedule and to communicate clearly in writing and with recorded videos. <a href="https://www.loom.com/share/1b92593aaf5f41abb2450869085dc3a5"><strong>Hear from our co-founder Michelle Lee on what it's like to work asynchronously (click here)</strong>.</a>
</li>
<li>We operate completely <strong>autonomously</strong> - no one will tell you what to do, we'll just tell you the goals and you will figure out how to work towards them with the rest of the team.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>role you'll play</strong> on our team:<ul>
<li>You'd be one of the <strong>first ten</strong> engineers on the team.</li>
<li>You'll <strong>work on</strong><ul>
<li>Backend: database design and implementation, complex data management problems, API design and implementation, writing tests</li>
<li>Frontend: building features in our react app, HTML/CSS + styled components, building amazing user experiences, writing tests</li>
<li>Frontend and backend: building and iterating on our product, collaborating with designers and founders, and making a product that users will love.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Like all start-ups we're scrappy, but not scrappy on compensation: Subscript is committed to paying our awesome team members at <strong>market-rate, including benefits.</strong>
</li>
</ul><div><br></div><div>
<strong>Our interview process<br></strong><br>
</div><div>Our interview process is designed to focus on <strong>your skills</strong> as a software engineer, and your ability to <strong>communicate clearly</strong>. We're a fully asynchronous company, so that's how we will communicate in this interview process too 🙂.<br><br>
</div><ol>
<li>We'll ask you to work on a small code challenge</li>
<li>After reviewing the short code challenge, we'll ask you to work on a <strong>~90 minute exercise </strong>while recording a loom (or other screen recording) video.</li>
<li>If the video interview above goes well, we'll want to learn a bit more about <strong>how you communicate in writing</strong> - we will ask you to put together a <strong>technical design document</strong>. This is one of the biggest ways we communicate at Subscript, so we want to see that you can work well with that!</li>
</ol><div>And finally, hopefully we'll send you an offer. And hopefully you'll accept!<br><br>
</div><div>
<strong>Requirements<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>You're an excellent engineer (you write high quality code, you write great tests, you ship quickly)</li>
<li>You're a great communicator via writing, and via recorded videos.</li>
<li>You're excited about working on a globally-distributed and diverse team, in an incredibly unique culture where autonomy, accountability, and ownership are equally as valued as your skillset.</li>
<li>That's it!</li>
</ul><div>
<strong>Benefits<br></strong><br>
</div><ul>
<li>Unlimited vacation</li>
<li>Completely flexible work schedule - work literally anytime (and anywhere) you want!</li>
<li>Benefits appropriate to your location (health/dental/vision in the USA)</li>
<li>Company wide retreats multiple times per year</li>
<li>Like all start-ups we're scrappy, but not scrappy on compensation: Subscript is committed to paying our awesome team members at market-rate, including benefits.</li>

<div>Ever wish your CEO encouraged you to write more automated tests? Or even just understood their importance? Want to work where <strong>clean code isn’t a luxury but a priority?</strong>  </div><div>
<br><strong>Our founder and CEO is a developer himself</strong>, and our<strong> elegant code </strong>is the vein that keeps our company healthy and growing. You’ll never have to advocate for the <strong>importance of investing in code quality</strong>. You can save time (and frustrations) and spend it on <strong>doing what matters</strong> in a healthy, collaborative environment where<strong> your ideas, energy and time are valued</strong>. </div><div>
<br>You’ll be involved in all cycles of software development, including decision-making, so there are incredible opportunities for you to <strong>take initiative, make meaningful contributions, and grow</strong>. Forget political struggles or long, pointless debates. You’ll be in a team with minimal distance between word and action, where decisions are made ultra-fast.  </div><div>
<br>This is a <strong>rare opportunity </strong>to work exclusively with senior-level developers in a diverse, highly organized, result-driven environment where you can <strong>thrive personally and professionally</strong>.  </div><div>
<br>You’ll become an <strong>essential part of our team</strong>, someone who is making a direct impact on not only the core product and reputation of our organization but also the whole world of education and beyond! </div><div>
<br>The IxDF is the <strong>global leader in online UX/UI design education</strong>. We hold the trust of industry giants like Adobe and IBM, who rely on our courses to train their teams. Prestigious universities, including MIT and the University of Cambridge, use our material into their curricula. Help us <strong>take online education to new heights</strong> and make a <strong>meaningful impact on humankind</strong>. We’re entering our third decade with over 170,000 graduates. </div><div>
<br><strong>We’re proud to have assembled a remarkable team of unicorns</strong> who uplift, motivate, and push each other to excel daily. There's a seat open for someone who shares our passion for excellence. Could that be you? <br><br>
</div><div><strong>Project Overview </strong></div><div>
<br><strong>Our flagship product</strong> is a <strong>vast platform</strong> with over 30 sub-domains for online courses, masterclasses, online forums, and community meet-ups in 508 cities in 107 countries. We understand what PHP developers need to thrive, and we've created an environment that delivers.  </div><ul>
<li>
<strong>Close to Legacy-Free Codebase.</strong> We know how technical debt and legacy code can turn into quicksand, so we continually eradicate it. Some examples include <strong>the complete rewrite of our notification and payment system </strong>and numerous enhancements made to our course platform<strong>.</strong> </li>
<li>
<strong>Consistent Coding Standards.</strong> We are proud of our strict coding standards, which is the cornerstone of our clean and maintainable codebase. You can find numerous examples in the <a href="https://handbook.interaction-design.org/">IxDF Handbook</a>, which includes our conventions for <a href="https://handbook.interaction-design.org/library/backend/conventions--php.html">PHP</a>, <a href="https://handbook.interaction-design.org/library/backend/conventions--laravel.html">Laravel</a>, <a href="https://handbook.interaction-design.org/library/backend/conventions--sql.html">SQL</a>, <a href="https://handbook.interaction-design.org/library/frontend/conventions--js.html">JavaScript</a>, and <a href="https://handbook.interaction-design.org/library/frontend/conventions--css.html">CSS</a>, along with other <a href="https://handbook.interaction-design.org/library/backend/literature.html">useful resources</a>. You can also find other examples in the <a href="https://ui-kit.interaction-design.org/">IxDF UI Kit,</a> which we’re currently rebuilding into an industry-leading  Design System and our <a href="https://ui-kit.interaction-design.org/components">handy IxDF component library</a>. </li>
<li>
<strong>Crystal-Clear Documentation.</strong> Clarity is key. Any line of code should be a succinct, well-crafted, and self-explanatory piece of communication to your future self or your colleague. To string things together, we mix in just the right amount of documentation, with best practices such as focusing on the “why?” and keeping it simple.  </li>
<li>
<strong>Focus on what matters</strong>: Our CI/CD pipeline uses quality tools such as Psalm, PHPStan, Rector, PHPCS, PHP-CS-Fixer, Deptrac, phpcpd, and ESLint to ensure consistency and code quality. This means we’re almost bug-free despite having numerous, zero-downtime, fully automated deployments to production every day. We don’t like bugs and would rather focus on what matters most. </li>
<li>
<strong>Test Coverage</strong>: “The only way to go fast is to go well - Robert C. Martin”. We love automated testing, especially Unit Tests, and use TDD as much as we can. We've been increasing our test coverage over the years, reaching an overall 38% test coverage throughout the system, with critical systems having over 80% test coverage. <br><br>
</li>
</ul><div><strong>The Stack You Will Work On </strong></div><div>
<br>#UseThePlatform. We focus on enduring technologies over the latest fleeting frameworks so that <strong>our developers' knowledge continually grows</strong> instead of becoming outdated after each trend has passed. This philosophy allows us to build robust, maintainable and <strong>beautiful code that stands the test of time</strong> rather than chasing the latest hype. Some of our key technologies include: </div><ul>

If your background is similar to the job description and you think you can excel in this role, please apply and tell us about yourself and the impact you could make at Elevate Labs.<br><br>
</div><div>We also know that diversity of identity, experience, and thought leads to more creativity, better problem-solving, and wiser decisions, which is why we're dedicated to adding new perspectives to our team. We are an equal opportunity employer; committed to diversity and building an equitable and inclusive environment for people of all backgrounds and experiences, and we're taking steps to meet that commitment.
